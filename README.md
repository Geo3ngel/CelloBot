# Cello Bot!
A discord bot intended to assist with recording DND sessions via individualizing audio tracks for each participant.
## Feature Set
- [ ] Multi-track recording for every individual person in the discord call!
- [ ] Ability to play music in the discord!
	- Rip off other Music playing bots for this!
- [ ] Add additional ability to play sound effects!
	- based on emoji mentioned in a certain channel maybe?
	- Basically include the "Nitro" sound board stuff, but extended/free lol.
	- Bonus points if I can make Cello-bot select the emoji to have show up on their screen!

# Tech Stack
Python 3.11.9
- Or v3.10.12

PyCord
- recording each member of the call into separate audio files!
	- Or audio streams, ideally!
- Credit to the following [repo](https://github.com/limitcantcode/jaison-core/tree/v1.6-final) for Audio channel separation recording!
gRpc
- For server/client communication?
- Could I use this to communicate between multiple apps/clients run locally? 
	- Effectively to bridge between different languages for communication?
	- There are defiantly better tools/ways of doing this!

Try to set up with WLS 2?
